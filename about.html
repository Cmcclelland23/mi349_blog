    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <h3>My name is Camden McClelland</h3>
    <p>I am a Senior at Michigan State University, studying Game and Web Design. I am from Pittsburgh PA so I am a big fan of all things Pittsburgh. My favorite NFL team is the Steelers, my favorite NHL team is the Penguins and of course, my faovrite MLB team is the Pirates. I live about 25 minutes from downtown (when there's no traffic of course) so I have been very blessed to be able to visit the city a lot and enjoy everything it has to offer. I also play inline hockey for MSU, we travel all over the area playing tournaments against other big schools.</p>
